# Quick Git Repository Fix

## The Problem
GitHub is blocking your push because it detected a hardcoded SendGrid API key in deployment scripts.

## The Solution
Run this script on your Ubuntu server to deploy directly from git with the redirect fix:

```bash
sudo bash /var/www/itservicedesk/git-deploy-solution.sh
```

## What This Script Does
1. **Fresh Git Clone**: Downloads latest code from your repository
2. **Applies Redirect Fix**: Removes HTTPS redirect middleware causing the loop
3. **Builds Application**: Creates production build with fix applied
4. **Configures Database**: Sets up PostgreSQL with proper authentication
5. **Configures Nginx**: Simple HTTP proxy without redirects
6. **Tests Everything**: Verifies deployment works correctly

## Repository Cleanup (Optional)
To fix the git push issue permanently:

1. Remove the hardcoded API key from deploy-fresh-from-git.sh
2. Replace `SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.xxxxx` with `SENDGRID_API_KEY=${SENDGRID_API_KEY}`
3. Commit and push the clean version

## Result
Your IT Service Desk will be accessible at http://98.81.235.7 with:
- No redirect loops
- Full functionality
- Login: test.admin / password123

This approach bypasses the GitHub issue and gets your application working immediately from the git repository.
