# Quick Fix for Your Production Server

Your Ubuntu server has ES module compatibility issues. Run this command to fix it:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skprabakaran122/itservicedesk/main/simple-frontend-fix.sh
sudo bash simple-frontend-fix.sh
```

## What This Does

1. Creates a CommonJS production server (no ES module conflicts)
2. Serves your complete React application with all functionality
3. Connects to your PostgreSQL database with all data
4. Fixes the changes screen blank issue

## Expected Result

- Access: https://98.81.235.7
- Login: john.doe / password123
- Complete dashboard with tickets, changes, products, users
- Changes screen shows actual data instead of blank
- All authentication and features working

This approach uses traditional Node.js CommonJS modules that work reliably in production Ubuntu environments.
