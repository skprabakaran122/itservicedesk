# Fix External Access to Your Server

Your application is likely running but not accessible from outside due to nginx/firewall configuration. Run this command on your Ubuntu server:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skprabakaran122/itservicedesk/main/complete-access-fix.sh
sudo bash complete-access-fix.sh
```

## What This Fixes

1. **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: Configures HTTPS proxy from port 443 to your application on port 5000
2. **SSL Certificates**: Creates self-signed certificates for HTTPS access
3. **Firewall Rules**: Opens ports 80 and 443 for web access
4. **Service Configuration**: Ensures both nginx and your application start properly

## Expected Result

- External access: https://98.81.235.7
- Login: john.doe / password123
- Complete IT Service Desk functionality

## If Still Connection Refused

The issue may be at the cloud provider level:
1. Check AWS/Cloud security groups allow inbound port 443
2. Verify your IP address isn't blocked
3. Try accessing from a different network

This resolves server-side configuration to make your application accessible from the internet.
