# Manual Git Push Fix

## The Problem
GitHub is blocking your push because of a hardcoded SendGrid API key in your repository history.

## Manual Fix Steps

Run these commands in your terminal to fix the git push:

```bash
# 1. Remove the git lock file
rm .git/index.lock

# 2. Check what files are staged
git status

# 3. Remove any problematic files (if they exist)
rm -f deploy-fresh-from-git.sh

# 4. Stage all changes
git add -A

# 5. Create a clean commit
git commit -m "Clean repository: remove hardcoded secrets

- Remove files containing hardcoded SendGrid API keys
- Prepare for clean GitHub push
- Maintain deployment functionality through secure scripts"

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Alternative: Force Push (Use Carefully)
If the above doesn't work, you can force push to overwrite the problematic history:

```bash
git push origin main --force
```

**Warning**: Force push will overwrite the remote repository. Only use if you're sure.

## After Successful Push
Once git push works, you can deploy using the clean deployment script:

```bash
# On your Ubuntu server:
sudo bash /var/www/itservicedesk/git-deploy-solution.sh
```

This will clone the clean repository and deploy your IT Service Desk without any hardcoded secrets.

## Verification
After deployment, your IT Service Desk will be accessible at:
- URL: http://98.81.235.7
- Login: test.admin / password123
