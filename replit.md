# IT Service Desk System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive IT Service Desk system built for Calpion, designed to handle tickets, change requests, user management, and automated workflows. The system provides both internal staff management tools and public-facing support portals for external users.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack TypeScript architecture with:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with express-session

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for monorepo structure

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL adapter
- **File Storage**: Local file system with multer middleware
- **Email Service**: Dual provider support (SendGrid/SMTP) with Nodemailer fallback
- **SSL Support**: Custom SSL certificate management

### Database Schema
- **Core Entities**: Tickets, Changes, Users, Products, Attachments
- **Workflow Management**: Approval routing, change approvals, history tracking
- **Configuration**: Settings table for dynamic system configuration
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history tracking for tickets and changes

## Data Flow

### Ticket Management
1. Anonymous users can submit tickets via public portal
2. Tickets are routed based on approval rules and product assignments
3. Internal users can manage, update, and resolve tickets
4. Email notifications sent for status changes and approvals
5. SLA tracking and metrics calculation

### Change Management
1. Change requests follow approval workflows
2. Risk-based routing to appropriate approvers
3. Multi-level approval support with email-based approval
4. Change tracking with detailed history and audit trails

### User Management
1. Role-based access control (admin, agent, user)
2. Department and business unit organization
3. Dynamic approval routing based on user roles
