# IT Service Desk System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive IT Service Desk system built for Calpion, designed to handle tickets, change requests, user management, and automated workflows. The system provides both internal staff management tools and public-facing support portals for external users.

## System Architecture

The application follows a full-stack TypeScript architecture with:

- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM

## Recent Changes

### June 25, 2025 - Change Approval "Any One Approver" Bug Fixed ✓ COMPLETED
