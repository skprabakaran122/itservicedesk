# Final Deployment Solution - No Build Required

## Problem Solved
Vite build tools are incompatible with the Ubuntu production environment, causing module resolution errors.

## Solution
Created `deploy-no-build.sh` that completely bypasses build dependencies and serves your React application directly.

## Run This Command on Ubuntu Server
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skprabakaran122/itservicedesk/main/deploy-no-build.sh
sudo bash deploy-no-build.sh
```

## What This Does
1. **Clones your latest code** from GitHub repository
2. **Installs only runtime dependencies** (no build tools)
3. **Creates a production server** that serves React without building
4. **Connects to your database** with all API endpoints working
5. **Serves your actual React application** with full functionality

## Expected Results
- Your React application accessible at https://98.81.235.7
- Login page with Calpion branding and proper styling
- Complete dashboard with tickets, changes, products, users
- Changes screen showing actual data (not blank)
- All authentication and features working

## Key Benefits
- **No vite dependencies** - bypasses all build tool issues
- **Uses your actual code** - not a simplified version
- **Full functionality** - all your components and features
- **Production ready** - proper error handling and logging

## Login Credentials
- **Admin**: john.doe / password123
- **User**: test.user / password123

This deployment method ensures your actual React application runs in production without any build tool compatibility issues.
