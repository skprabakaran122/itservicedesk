# Replit Preview Access Guide

## Current Status
Your IT Service Desk application is running correctly on:
- **Local Server**: http://localhost:5000 (working)
- **Preview URL**: https://83e938a3-9929-4918-9e8c-133675a9935d-00-16gy3jb3aitja.kirk.replit.dev

## Issue Diagnosed
The server is running and responding correctly. The preview loading issue is with Replit's preview interface, not your application.

## Access Solutions

### Method 1: Direct URL Access
Open this URL directly in a new browser tab:
```
https://83e938a3-9929-4918-9e8c-133675a9935d-00-16gy3jb3aitja.kirk.replit.dev
```

### Method 2: Alternative Preview
1. Click the "Webview" tab in Replit (next to Console/Shell)
2. If it doesn't load, refresh the webview panel
3. Try opening in a new tab from the webview panel

### Method 3: Restart Preview
1. Stop the current workflow (click Stop button)
2. Wait 10 seconds
3. Click "Run" again
4. Wait for "HTTP server running" message
5. Try preview again

## Verification Steps
The server logs show:
- ✅ Email service configured
- ✅ Database connected
- ✅ HTTP server running on 0.0.0.0:5000
