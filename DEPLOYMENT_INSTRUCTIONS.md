# Deploy Your React Application to Production

Your IT Service Desk production server is running at https://98.81.235.7 with all backend services operational. Currently serving a simple frontend, but your actual React application needs to be deployed.

## Quick Deployment (Recommended)

Run this single command on your Ubuntu server to deploy your actual React application:

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skprabakaran122/itservicedesk/main/deploy-without-vite.sh | sudo bash
```

**OR** copy and run the script manually:

1. Copy the `deploy-without-vite.sh` script to your Ubuntu server
2. Run: `sudo bash deploy-without-vite.sh`

## What This Does

The deployment script handles multiple scenarios:

1. **First Attempt**: Tries `npm run build` to create a production build
2. **Second Attempt**: Uses `npx vite build` directly if npm script fails
3. **Third Attempt**: Tries alternative build commands
4. **Fallback Method**: If vite build fails completely, creates a production vite dev server that serves your full React application

## Expected Results

After deployment:
- **Your actual React application** will be accessible at https://98.81.235.7
- **All your components** (login, dashboard, tickets, changes, etc.) will work
- **Changes screen will show data** instead of being blank
- **All styling and functionality** from your development environment

## Login Credentials

- **Admin**: john.doe / password123
- **Manager**: jane.manager / password123
- **Agent**: bob.agent / password123
- **User**: test.user / password123

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check service status: `sudo systemctl status itservicedesk`
2. View logs: `sudo journalctl -u itservicedesk -f`
3. The script creates backups, so you can restore if needed

## Current Status

- Backend API: Fully operational with all endpoints
- Database: PostgreSQL with complete test data
- Infrastructure: Systemd service + Nginx HTTPS proxy
- Frontend: Simple version (needs your React app deployment)

Your changes screen blank issue will be resolved once your React application is deployed, as the production database contains the test changes data.
