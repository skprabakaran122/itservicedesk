# IT Service Desk - Final Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified

The application shows DATABASE_URL is available in environment tests but fails when tsx runs server/index.ts due to ES modules import order. The server/db.ts file imports before dotenv configuration executes.

## Solution

Run this final fix on your server:

```bash
cd /var/www/servicedesk
./fix_module_loading_order.sh
```

## What This Fix Does

1. **Updates server/db.ts** to load dotenv configuration before checking DATABASE_URL
2. **Ensures proper module loading order** for ES modules
3. **Tests multiple fallback methods** if the primary fix doesn't work
4. **Provides explicit environment variable passing** as backup

## Expected Result

After running the fix:
- Application starts without DATABASE_URL errors
- PM2 shows stable "online" status
- Application responds on port 3000
- Web interface accessible at http://your-server-ip

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status

# Test local response
curl http://localhost:3000

# View logs if needed
pm2 logs servicedesk
```

## Alternative Manual Fix

If the script doesn't work, manually edit `/var/www/servicedesk/server/db.ts`:

Add this at the very top:
```typescript
import { config } from 'dotenv';
config();
```

Then restart:
```bash
pm2 restart servicedesk
```

Your IT Service Desk will be fully operational with complete database connectivity, user authentication, ticket management, and email notifications.
